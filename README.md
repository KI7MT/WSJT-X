# WSJT-X
Python class to decode UDP packets coming from WSJT-X  

WSJT-X is an awesome digital mode package designed for weak-signal Amateur Radio communications.  
Thanks to Joe Taylor, K1JT, et al for the development of this program!

WSJT-X implements a UDP Client that sends and receives UDP packets to allow for interoperation
with other programs.  This is a Python class implementation to show, in Python, how the packets
are constructed and parsed.  A lot of the comments about the uses of the packets in the Python 
code came directly from the WSJT-X 1.8.0 r 8193 source code.

This is an ongoing project as well and I will be playing with the code on and off to implement 
cool things for WSJT-X as interoperabilty programs.
